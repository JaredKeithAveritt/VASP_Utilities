# Band structure calculations using VASP and vaspkit

## Step 1. Optimize Structures using VASP
the following is the recomended `INCAR` file directives
```fortran
### Relaxation 
 ENCUT = 500
 SIGMA = 0.010000
 PREC = Accurate
 IBRION = 2
 ISMEAR = 0
 NSW = 1000
 IVDW = 12                             
 LREAL = Auto
 EDIFF = 1.0e-7
 EDIFFG = -0.01
```

note: increase kpoints untill energy convergence

## Step 2. Convert POSCAR to standardized primitive cell

In the folder containing the `POSCAR` open vaspkit and select option `602`
Create a new folder and copy the `PRIMCELL.vasp` file into that folder as `POSCAR` using:
```bash
cp ../PRIMCELL.vasp POSCAR
```

## Step 3. Calculate CHGCAR file by performing a single-point self-consistent calculation

Starting with `POSCAR` files above and `POTCAR` and `batch.sh` files
Create `INCAR`

```fortran
 ENCUT = 500
 SIGMA = 0.010000
 PREC = Accurate
 IBRION = 0
 ISMEAR = 0
 IVDW = 12                             
 LREAL = Auto
 EDIFF = 1.0e-7
 EDIFFG = -0.01
```

Create `KPOINTS` File, for graphene/MoS2 that looks like

```plaintext
Comment Line
0
Monkhorst-Pack
5	5	1
0.0	0.0	0.0
```

## Step 5. Calculate DOS

A. Move `CHGCAR` file from previous step to new folder called `DOS`

B. Create INCAR

```fortran
 ISTART = 2
 PREC = Normal
 LREAL = Auto
 ENCUT = 500
 EDIFF = 1.0e-7
 IVDW = 12    
 ISMEAR = 0
 SIGMA = 0.010000
 ICHARG = 11
```

C. Create `KPATH.in` file  using VASPKIT option `302` and copy/save it as KPOINTS file, it will look like this (this can be double checked and visualized in [seeK-path](https://www.materialscloud.org/work/tools/seekpath):
