# Band structure calculations using VASP and vaspkit

## Step 1. Optimize Structures using VASP

create a folder named `opt`

create an `INCAR` file
```fortran
### Relaxation 
 ENCUT = 500
 SIGMA = 0.010000
 PREC = Accurate
 IBRION = 2
 ISMEAR = 0
 NSW = 1000
 IVDW = 12                             
 LREAL = Auto
 EDIFF = 1.0e-7
 EDIFFG = -0.01
```
create a `KPOINTS` file (example)
```fortran
K-Spacing Value to Generate K-Mesh: 0.030
0
Monkhorst-Pack
  15  15   1
0.0  0.0  0.0
```

generate POTCAR and POSCAR

note: increase kpoints untill energy convergence
note: N N 1 for graphene
note: N M ? for mos2 ? 

## Step 2. Convert POSCAR to standardized primitive cell

In the `opt` folder containing the `CONTCAR` 

```bash
cp POSCAR POSCAR.opt
rm POSCAR 
cp CONTCAR POSCAR
```
open vaspkit and select option `602`
```bash
rm POSCAR
```
you should have no `POSCAR` file, but instead two files: `POSCAR.opt` and `PRIMCELL.vasp`

an additional file that is generated `SYMMETRY` 


## Step 3. Calculate CHGCAR file by performing a single-point self-consistent calculation

Create a new folder called `scf` and copy the `PRIMCELL.vasp` file into that folder as `POSCAR` using:

```bash
cp ../opt/PRIMCELL.vasp POSCAR
```

copy `POTCAR` and `batch.sh` files from `opt` folder to `scf` folder

Create `INCAR`
```fortran
Global Parameters
NCORE  =  4
ISTART =  1            (Read existing wavefunction, if there)
ISPIN  =  1            (Non-Spin polarised DFT)
LREAL  = .FALSE.       (Projection operators: automatic)
ENCUT  =  500        (Cut-off energy for plane wave basis set, in eV)
PREC   =  Accurate   (Precision level: Normal or Accurate, set Accurate when perform structure lattice relaxation calculation)
LWAVE  = .TRUE.        (Write WAVECAR or not)
LCHARG = .TRUE.        (Write CHGCAR or not)
ADDGRID= .TRUE.        (Increase grid, helps GGA convergence)
# LVTOT  = .TRUE.      (Write total electrostatic potential into LOCPOT or not)
# LVHAR  = .TRUE.      (Write ionic + Hartree electrostatic potential into LOCPOT or not)
# NELECT =             (No. of electrons: charged cells, be careful)
# LPLANE = .TRUE.      (Real space distribution, supercells)
# NWRITE = 2           (Medium-level output)
# KPAR   = 2           (Divides k-grid into separate groups)
# NGXF    = 300        (FFT grid mesh density for nice charge/potential plots)
# NGYF    = 300        (FFT grid mesh density for nice charge/potential plots)
# NGZF    = 300        (FFT grid mesh density for nice charge/potential plots)
 
Static Calculation
ISMEAR =  0            (gaussian smearing method)
SIGMA  =  0.05         (please check the width of the smearing)
LORBIT =  11           (PAW radii for projected DOS)
NEDOS  =  2001         (DOSCAR points)
NELM   =  60           (Max electronic SCF steps)
EDIFF  =  1E-08        (SCF energy convergence, in eV)
```

Create `KPATH.in` file  using VASPKIT option `302` and copy/save it as `KPOINTS` file, 
```bash
cp CONTCAR POSCAR
```
it will look like this (this can be double checked and visualized in [Link: seeK-path](https://www.materialscloud.org/work/tools/seekpath):

   0.0000000000   0.0000000000   0.0000000000     GAMMA    
```

## Step 4. Calculate DOS

NOTE: make sure that `PRECISION` and `ENCUT` are the same in the `INCAR` file
Copy `CHGCAR` file from previous step to new folder called `DOS`
Copy `WAVECAR` file from `scf` folder to `DOS` folder

Create `INCAR`
```fortran
 ISTART = 2
 PREC = Accurate
 LREAL = Auto
 ENCUT = 500
 EDIFF = 1.0e-7
 IVDW = 12    
 ISMEAR = 0
 SIGMA = 0.010000
 ICHARG = 11
```
## Step 4. Generate DOS plots
note: must not be done using terminus, use the default terminal and have -X11 forwarding turned on.
