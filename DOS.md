#DOS

## In Bash
The given command is a gnuplot command used to plot data from the DOSCAR file generated by VASP. Let's break it down:

```gnuplot
plot "<awk 'NR==7,NR==(7+301)' DOSCAR" u 1:2 w l
```

- `plot`: Specifies that a plot is to be created.
- `"<awk 'NR==7,NR==(7+301)' DOSCAR"`: This is a command that uses `awk` to extract a specific range of lines from the DOSCAR file. It selects lines starting from line 7 and ending at line 307 (7 + 301) and passes this filtered data to gnuplot for plotting.
- `u 1:2`: Specifies that the plot should use the first column as the x-values and the second column as the y-values.
- `w l`: Specifies that the plot should be created with lines connecting the data points.

In summary, this gnuplot command reads data from the specified range in the DOSCAR file and plots it using lines, where the x-values come from the first column, and the y-values come from the second column. The `awk` command is used here to extract a specific range of lines from the DOSCAR file before plotting.

Note: The specific range (from line 7 to line 307) and the number of columns in the DOSCAR file may vary based on the actual structure of your DOSCAR file.

## In Python 

To achieve the equivalent in matplotlib, you can use the following Python code. Assuming you've already loaded the DOSCAR data into `energy_values` and `total_dos`, you can use Matplotlib to create a line plot:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming energy_values and total_dos are loaded from DOSCAR file

# Select the range from -5 to 5 eV
energy_range = (energy_values >= -5) & (energy_values <= 5)
filtered_energy_values = energy_values[energy_range]
filtered_total_dos = total_dos[energy_range]

# Plot the data
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.plot(filtered_energy_values, filtered_total_dos, label='Total DOS', color='blue')
plt.axhline(0, color='black', linestyle='--', linewidth=0.8)  # Horizontal line at y=0
plt.xlabel('Energy (eV)')
plt.ylabel('Density of States')
plt.title('Density of States (DOS)')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This code selects only the data points in the range from -5 to 5 eV and then plots them using Matplotlib's `plot` function. Adjust the `filtered_energy_values` and `filtered_total_dos` based on your actual data.

Make sure to replace the assumed variables (`energy_values` and `total_dos`) with the actual variables you have in your code.
