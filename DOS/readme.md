The `KPOINTS` file dictates the sampling of the Brillouin zone and is crucial for determining the accuracy of your VASP calculations. Below are examples of what the `KPOINTS` file might look like for each step in a DOS calculation, reflecting typical settings for monolayer 2D materials. Remember, the optimal k-point grid depends on the size and symmetry of your unit cell, as well as the nature of your calculation.

Note: The choice between even or odd numbers in the k-point grid size can matter, depending on the type of calculation and the nature of the material being studied. Perform convergence tests to ensure that your results are reliable. Here's how the choice can affect your VASP calculations:

1. **Metals and Semimetals**:
   - For metals and semimetals, using an odd number of k-points (e.g., `3x3x3`, `5x5x5`) is often recommended, especially when using the Monkhorst-Pack grid scheme. This is because an odd grid ensures that the k-point mesh includes the Gamma point (0,0,0), which is important for accurately capturing the electronic states near the Fermi level in metallic systems.
   - For calculations involving metallic systems where the Fermi surface needs to be accurately resolved, not including the Gamma point can lead to inaccuracies in the calculated properties like electronic density of states, conductivity, etc.

2. **Insulators and Semiconductors**:
   - For insulators and semiconductors, the choice between even and odd grids is less critical because there are no states at the Fermi level (since there's a band gap). However, using a Gamma-centered grid can still be beneficial for certain properties.
   - In these materials, using a Gamma-centered grid (which happens naturally with odd numbers of k-points) can still help with the convergence of total energies and electronic properties, although the overall impact is typically less dramatic than in metallic systems.

3. **Gamma-Centered vs. Monkhorst-Pack**:
   - A Gamma-centered grid (often resulting from odd numbers of divisions) is typically used for metals and ensures that the k-point set includes the Gamma point. This can be particularly important for accurate DOS calculations.
   - Monkhorst-Pack grids, which can be centered around the Gamma point or not, are more flexible. If you choose an even number of k-points in a Monkhorst-Pack grid, the Gamma point will not be explicitly included, which might be fine for insulators but less ideal for metals.

4. **Convergence Testing**:
   - Regardless of whether you start with an even or odd number of k-points, it's crucial to perform convergence testing for your specific system. Increase the number of k-points until your results (such as total energy, forces, or DOS) do not change significantly.
   - The choice between even and odd can also depend on the symmetry and size of your unit cell. For larger cells (particularly those extended in one or two dimensions), fewer k-points might be needed in the extended directions.


### 1. Relaxation (Geometry Optimization):

For relaxation, a moderate k-point mesh is usually sufficient:

```
Automatic mesh
0               ! Number of k-points = 0 (let VASP determine the grid)
Gamma           ! Centered at the Gamma point
5 5 1           ! Grid size; adjust based on your cell size and symmetry
0 0 0           ! Shift (usually 0 0 0 for Gamma-centered grids)
```

In this example, a `5x5x1` grid is used. You might need to adjust the grid density based on your material's cell size and symmetry.

### 2. Self-Consistent Field (SCF) Calculation:

For the SCF calculation, the same k-point mesh as the relaxation step can often be used; however, for systems where electronic properties are more sensitive, you might consider increasing the density:

```
Automatic mesh
0               ! Number of k-points = 0
Gamma           ! Centered at the Gamma point
7 7 1           ! Increased grid size for better electronic structure resolution
0 0 0           ! Shift (usually 0 0 0 for Gamma-centered grids)
```

This is a `7x7x1` grid, which provides a finer k-point sampling than used in the relaxation step.

### 3. Non-SCF Calculation for DOS:

For DOS calculations, a finer k-point grid is typically required to get accurate DOS profiles:

```
Automatic mesh
0               ! Number of k-points = 0
Gamma           ! Centered at the Gamma point
9 9 1        ! Fine grid for detailed DOS features
0 0 0           ! Shift (usually 0 0 0 for Gamma-centered grids)
```

Here, a `9x9x1` grid is used, which is denser to ensure detailed and accurate DOS results.

### Notes:

- The "Gamma" setting is typically used for metals and systems where the electronic states near the Fermi level are of interest. For insulators, the Monkhorst-Pack scheme might be more appropriate.
- The grid size (e.g., `5x5x1`, `7x7x1`, `9x9x1`) should be <u>increased for smaller unit cells and decreased for larger unit cells</u>. The right balance needs to be found between computational cost and accuracy.
- Always check the convergence with respect to the k-point grid by increasing the grid size until your results (total energy, forces, band structure, DOS, etc.) do not change significantly.

The `INCAR` files for each step in a VASP calculation. Remember, these are basic templates and might need adjustments based on your specific system and requirements.

### 1. Relaxation (Geometry Optimization):

For the initial relaxation step, your `INCAR` file might look like this:

```
SYSTEM = Your_system_name_here
ISTART = 0           ! Start from scratch
# ENCUT = 520          ! Plane-wave energy cutoff (in eV, adjust based on your pseudopotentials)
IBRION = 2           ! Use the conjugate gradient algorithm for ionic updates
# ISIF = 3             ! Relax internal coordinates and cell shape
NSW = 100            ! Maximum number of ionic steps
EDIFF = 1E-5         ! Energy convergence criterion (in eV)
EDIFFG = -0.02       ! Forces convergence criterion (in eV/Å, negative for relaxation)
NWRITE = 2           ! Reduce output verbosity
```

### 2. Self-Consistent Field (SCF) Calculation:

After relaxation, for the SCF calculation to get a converged charge density:

```
SYSTEM = Your_system_name_here
ISTART = 0           ! Start from scratch or set to 1 if continuing from previous wavefunctions
# ENCUT = 520          ! Keep consistent with the relaxation step
IBRION = -1          ! No ionic updates
ISMEAR = 0           ! Gaussian smearing, adjust according to your system
SIGMA = 0.05         ! Smearing width (in eV)
NSW = 0              ! No ionic steps
EDIFF = 1E-6         ! Tighter energy convergence criterion than in relaxation
NWRITE = 2           ! Reduce output verbosity
```

### 3. Non-SCF Calculation for DOS:

Finally, for the DOS calculation (non-SCF), your `INCAR` file changes to:

```
SYSTEM = Your_system_name_here
ISTART = 1           ! Start from existing wavefunctions
ICHARG = 11          ! Use the CHGCAR from the SCF run without updating it
# ENCUT = 520          ! Keep consistent with previous steps
ISMEAR = -5          ! Tetrahedron method with Blöchl corrections, preferred for DOS ! metals or graphene use 0  ? ? ? 
EDIFF = 1E-6         ! Energy convergence criterion, can be the same as in the SCF step
LORBIT = 11          ! Write out projected DOS
NEDOS = 3000         ! Number of energy points for DOS, adjust for resolution
NWRITE = 2           ! Reduce output verbosity
```

Note: The settings might vary based on your material type, precision requirements, and computational resources.
